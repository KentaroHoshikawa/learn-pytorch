    "1. Experience Replay  \n",
    "メモリに各ステップの内容を保存しておいて、後からランダムに取り出して(replay)、ニューラルネットワークに学習させる方法。ここでの、1ステップの内容を **transition**とも呼ぶ。  \n",
    "殊、ゲームの学習では時間的な相関がとても高い。すなわち、隣接する時刻での学習内容が非常に似ているため、結合パラメータの学習が安定しづらいという問題がある。Experience Replayではこの問題が解消され、さらに、ミニバッチで学習させることもできる。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fixed Target Q-Network  \n",
    "行動を決定する**main network**と誤差関数の計算時に行動価値を求める**target network**の2種類のニューラルネットで構成される。\n",
    "Q学習では$Q(s_t, a)$と$\\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)$を求める必要があるが、両方を同じQ関数にすると更新が不安定になるらしい。そこで、後者については少し前の時間のQ関数(Fixed Target Q-network)を使って計算する。\n",
    "\n",
    "    少し前の時間のQ関数は結合パラメータが少し前ものであるという意味で、target networkは定期的にmain networkで上書きされる。\n",
    "3. 報酬のクリッピング  \n",
    "報酬の集合を制限する。\n",
